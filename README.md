# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for a selection of Codewars kata (programming problems). The goal is to keep concise, runnable Python implementations together with notes on how the solutions were produced and how to use them locally and on Codewars.

What's inside

- `codewars_solutions.py` â€” a single script containing the implemented solutions and small example runs. Each solution function is commented with the kata name (or short description) and examples.

Quick setup (Windows / PowerShell)

1. Install Python 3.10+ (https://www.python.org/).
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   powershell
   python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Run the solutions file to see example outputs:

   powershell
   python codewars_solutions.py

How these solutions were created

- Read each kata description on Codewars and implement a minimal, readable Python function that satisfies the requirements and the provided examples.
- Included one or more inline examples or a simple test harness inside `codewars_solutions.py` so you can run the file and quickly verify outputs.
- Solutions favor clarity and correctness over micro-optimizations, but include brief comments about algorithmic complexity when relevant.
